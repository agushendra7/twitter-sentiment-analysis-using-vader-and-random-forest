# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Random Forest Classifier

I conducted a comparison of word weighting using Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF, in classifying sentiment on tweets of motorcycle racing events at Mandalika Circuit. The dataset was taken from February 04, 2022, to March 27, 2022, with a total dataset of 23526.

## Requirements
There are some general library requirements for the project and some which are specific to individual methods. The general requirements are as follows.

- **NumPy** [https://numpy.org] - Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.
- **Pandas** [https://pandas.pydata.org] - Fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.
- **NLTK** [https://www.nltk.org] - Standard python library with prebuilt functions and utilities for the ease of use and implementation.
- **Scikit-learn** [https://scikit-learn.org] - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.

The library requirements specific to some methods are:
- **Seaborn** [https://seaborn.pydata.org] - It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **Matplotlib** [https://matplotlib.org] - Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Swifter** [https://pypi.org/project/swifter] - A package which efficiently applies any function to a pandas dataframe or series in the fastest available manner.
